* Introduction
This is *Psimacs*, a /modern/ *Emacs* configuration build from the ground up using a [[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]] technique.
The complete configuration [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/][Elisp]] code is embedded into a single [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] file. This is the file that your are
currently reading.

Additionally, *Psimacs* allows the synchronization of the user's local *Emacs* configuration with a configuration
repository residing on [[https://www.dropbox.com/][Dropbox]]. This comes quite handy if sharing of one configuration with multiple machines is
desired.

This document not only describes the *Psimacs* configuration, but also some additional information useful
for working with *Emacs* in general. In this respect it serves as a kind of mind map for the author.

Some great useful *Emacs* references:
- [[http://ergoemacs.org/][Xah Emacs Site]]

** Motivation

A lot of *Emacs* configurations can be found on the Internet. Many of them are well crafted and could be used out of
the box. Especially, the great *Emacs* distributions like [[https://www.spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs]], [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom-Emacs]] and [[https://github.com/seagle0128/.emacs.d][Centaur-Emacs]] are worth giving a try.
But I wanted to craft my own configuration that is tailored to my needs and that allowed me to learn more about the
vast *Emacs* universe. My configuration it not perfect for everyone and it will not be able to compete against the big
frameworks that are build by a lot of talented people. So feel free to use it or blame it. I am fine with it.

The name *Psimacs* is arbitrarily. I was in search for a catchy name with just one syllable in front of the *macs*.

** Installation

This configuration uses *Emacs* >= 27. Clone the git repository into your *.emcas.d* directory

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.bak
git clone https://github.com/hatlafax/psimacs.git ~/.emacs.d
#+END_EXAMPLE

and just run *Emacs*.

The only file really needed is the =early-init.el= file. On startup, it reads the file =init.org= and extracts all the
initialization code into the main =init.el= and various additionally =config/init-*.el= files. The created =init.el=
file is then read and evaluated in the further startup procedure. The =init.el= file loads the other =config/init-*.el=
files on evaluation.

Never edit transient file =init.el= or =config/init-*.el= directly. They will be overridden by the next run of
*Psimacs*. Instead modify the =init.org= file to change your configuration.

You can create a HTML document =init.html= of this file by simply typing =C-c C-e h h= in the *Emacs* buffer for
this file. It is recommended to use this =init.html= for browser reading.

** Usage

All functions and variables that are defined in *Psimacs* are prefixed by a path like string  =psimacs/category=.
The /category/ is used to order the functions and variables by topic. For example the /string/ related function
/starts-with/ is defined as =psimacs/string/starts-with=.

** Dependencies

The configuration does have some dependencies that should be installed separately and beforehand of *Psimacs*.
On default the non *Emacs* dependencies are expected to be installed into directory *c:/utils/* on /Windows OS/.
A directory constant =psimacs/config/dependencies-dir= will be defined by the configuration that allows to change
the default location of the dependencies.

** Disclaimer

This is an *Emacs* beginners configuration and the usage is at one's own risk. It is not tested thoroughly. Please
bear in mind.

Many of the configuration settings are borrowed from other similar endeavors out there.

This is work in progress. Sometimes this *Readme* is ahead of times or not yet updated.

** Limitations / Known Issues

- Tested on Windows operating system only

* Working with Org-Mode
** Embedding code
[[https://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]] allows embedding of source code blocks into =.org=-files and evaluating them by [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][babel]] a core feature build
into [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Working-with-Source-Code.html][org]]. The [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/][Elisp]] code is embedded into special code blocks:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
<BODY>
#+END_SRC
#+END_EXAMPLE

Code block with =:tangle yes= or with =:tangle filename= are part of the configuration. However, any code block
can be deactivated, i.e. omitted from the configuration, by using =:tangle no= in the
block declaration.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
(message "this should never be seen in the Message buffer!")
#+END_SRC
#+END_EXAMPLE

Additionally, a whole section can also be deactivated by a /CANCELED/ or a /DISABLED/ item, e.g.:

*** CANCELED Avoid generating /Emacs Lisp/ code per section

The following [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/][Elisp]] block should therefore also not be part of the generated =.el= file although the =:tangle yes=
attribute was used. Same is true for /Disabled/ as well as tag /:noexport:/

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(message "this should not be seen in the Message buffer!")
#+END_SRC
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Debugging the configuration

Loading of the configuration can always be halted on spot by entering and activating the following source code block
which will enter enter the debugger on execution.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
(debug)
#+END_SRC
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Working with ELisp
This section gives some basic help with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/][Elisp]] and debugging of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/][Elisp]] code.

** Debugging ELisp with EDebug
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Edebug.html#Edebug][Edebug]] is a source-level debugger for Emacs Lisp programs that is very useful developing /Lisp/ code. In the following
you can find some useful commands and settings for debugging with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Edebug.html#Edebug][Edebug]]:

- Using  [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Edebug.html#Edebug][Edebug]]:
  To debug a Lisp program with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Edebug.html#Edebug][Edebug]], you must first instrument the Lisp code that you want to debug.
  A simple way to do this is to first move point into the definition of a function or macro and then do
  =C-u C-M-x=.

Embedding a breakpoint into source code: =(edebug)=

* Key binding
I am trying to setup keybinding in a /mnemonics/ way so it's easy to remember (and use).
I am staying with the /standard/ emacs keybinding as much as possible.

*Emacs*'s keybindings has well-defined conventions listed at [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html%5Fnode/elisp/Key-Binding-Conventions.html][Emacs Key Bindings Convention]].
In summary, the general rules are:
- =C-x= reserved for Emacs native essential keybindings: buffer, window, frame, file, directory, etc.
- =F5= ... =F9= without modifier keys are reserved for users to define.
- =C-c=
    - =C-c C-letter=, =C-c digit= are reserved for major modes.
    - =C-c punctuation= with punctuation in { } < > : ; are also reserved for major modes.
    - =C-c punctuation= with any other punctuation are allocated for minor modes.
    - =C-c letter= are reserved for users. In practice most third-party packages don't give a hoot
      and will gladly stuff their own key binds in there.
- Don't rebind =C-g=, =C-h= and =ESC=.
- =hyper= and =super= are two prefix keys reserved to you. They are remnants from ancient keyboards used in the 80s,
  but live on today in Emacs. Most PC-compatible  keyboards won't have a =super= or =hyper= key so we rebind
  the =<lwindow>= and =<rwindow>= /Windows/ keys and the =<apps> /Application Context/ key to be the =super=
  and =hyper= prefix keys instead.

*Psimacs* uses the =super= and =hyper= key prefixes for all of its own key bindings.

** Remapping the Capslock key

The /Ctrl/ key is one of the most used keys, although it is one of the most inconvenient
and ergonomically bad key to type possible leading to strain injury when used often as in *Emacs*.

On the other hand, /Capslock/ while in a convenient position is one of the most useless keys as it
is not used often and upper case letters can be typed just by holding the shift key while typing
the underlying letter.

Also the /Print Screen/ (often abbreviated /Print Scrn/, /Prnt Scrn/, /Prt Scrn/, /Prt Scn/, /Prt Scr/,
/Prt Sc/ or /Pr Sc/ and in german /Druck/ or /Drucken/) save a bitmap image of the current screen,
or screenshot, to their clipboard or comparable storage area. In my whole life time, I actually never used
this key.

Therefore I remap my /Left-Ctrl/ also to the /Capslock/ key and the /Capslock/ key to the /Prnt Scrn/ key.
This way I lose the original /Prnt Scrn/ functionality, but I don't bother. The reason that I do not simply
exchange the /Left-Ctrl/ and /Capslock/ keys is that after years I'm used to the /Left-Ctrl/ key and I still
press this key often automatically. This however, is disruptive when I have changed the meaning of the /Left-Ctrl/
key. So basically, now I have two /Left-Ctrl/ keys and no /Prnt Scrn/ :-).

In the following I describe the way I have done that on my Windows 10 based machine. The change can be performed by
providing the following entry to the /Windows Registry/:

#+begin_example
regedit
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout
Edit -> New -> Binary Value -> "Scancode Map"

00 00 00 00  # The header version, which is always 0
00 00 00 00  # The header flag, which is always 0
03 00 00 00  # The sum of number of key entries to change and the extra NULL terminator line. In this case 2 key entries changed, therefore, 3.
1d 00 3a 00  # Map Left-Ctrl key to Capslock key
3a 00 37 e0  # Map Capslock key to Prnt Scrn key
00 00 00 00  # NULL terminator line
#+end_example

| Key         | Scancode |
|-------------+----------|
| =Left-Ctrl= | 1d 00    |
| =Capslock=  | 3a 00    |
| =Prnt Scrn= | 37 e0    |

* Early initialization

Starting with *Emacs* 27, an early-init.el file can be used to do early configuration and optimization.
For more information read [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Starting-Up.html#Starting-Up][Starting Up Emacs]] and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Init-File.html][The Init File]].

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Emacs can now be configured using an early init file. The file is called early-init.el, in user-emacs-directory.
It is loaded very early in the startup process: before graphical elements such as the tool bar are initialized,
and before the package manager is initialized. The primary purpose is to allow customizing how the package
system is initialized given that initialization now happens before loading the regular init file (see below).

We recommend against putting any customizations in this file that don't need to be set up before initializing
installed add-on packages, because the early init file is read too early into the startup process, and some
important parts of the Emacs session, such as 'window-system' and other GUI features, are not yet set up,
which could make some customization fail to work.
#+END_QUOTE

*Psimacs* uses the =early-init.el= for three purposes. At first, the evaluation of this file tangles the =init.org= file's
embedded elips source code into the corresponding elips files. Especially, the =early-init.el= file is itself
updated on this way, as it is also described in the =init.org= file. Crazy isn't is :-). Secondly, the =early-init.el=
is responsible for synchronizing with a *Psimacs* /dropbox/ repository. This is quite useful when working with multiple
machines and sharing the very same *Emacs* environment. Thirdly, the primary duty of the =early-init.el= file is to
optimize the *Emacs* startup procedure.

As mentioned above, the elisp source of this section is tangled directly into the =early-init.el= file. Since the
tangling happens at startup time on evaluation of the =early-init.el= file, the =early-init.el= might overwritten
itself at startup.

** Preamble

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle early-init.el :var file-description="Early initialization"
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Emacs 27 introduces early-init.el, which is run before init.el,
;; before package and UI initialization happens.
;;
#+END_SRC

** Some basic constants

*** Tangle anything at startup

*Psimacs* allows the tangling of the configuration source code at startup time. The following flag allows to suppresses
this feature completely.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle early-init.el
;;
;; Tangling procedure constants.
;;
(defconst psimacs/config/tangle-anything t
  "If this flag is nil no code is generated by the startup.
This flag allows to only use the 'init-*.el' files of the framework.")
#+END_SRC

*** Tangle early-init.el at startup

*Psimacs* allows the tangling of the =early-init.el= file itself at startup. The following flag suppresses
this feature.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle early-init.el
(defconst psimacs/config/tangle-early-init-file t
  "If this flag is t the 'early-init.el' file is generated at startup.
If nil, only the 'early-init.el' file is omitted from the code generation process.")
#+END_SRC

*** Synchronize with Dropbox at startup

*Psimacs* allows the synchronization of files and folders with a /Dropbox/ repository at startup time.
The following flag allows inhibition of this feature.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle early-init.el
;;
;; Synchronization procedure constants.
;;
(defconst psimacs/config/synchronize-at-startup t
  "If this flag is t the 'early-init.el' file synchronizes the configuration with Dropbox.
The local configuration can be synchronized with a mirror configuration on Dropbox. This
allows sharing of a single configuration on multiple machines.")
#+END_SRC

*** Some size numbers

Huge byte sizes are conveniently written in /Mega Bytes/ or even in /Giga Bytes/ by *Psimacs*. Therefore we define
some size constants early.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle early-init.el
;;
;; Conveniency byte size constants
;;
(defconst   1MB (* 1024 1024))
(defconst   4MB (*   4 1MB))
(defconst  20MB (*  20 1MB))
(defconst  30MB (*  30 1MB))
(defconst  50MB (*  50 1MB))
(defconst  64MB (*  64 1MB))
(defconst 128MB (* 128 1MB))
#+END_SRC

*** Primary initalization files and directories

The primary initialization files and directories must be known by the initialization process early in time in order
to allow the =early-init.el= to full fill its duty. These files are evaluated and/or synchronized with a possible
/dropbox/ repository.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle early-init.el
;;
;; Primary Psimacs file and directory constants use for tangling and synchronization
;;
(defconst psimacs/config/main-org-file-name "init.org"

  "The psimacs htmlized initialization file.")

(defconst psimacs/config/icon-file-name "psi.ico"
  "The psimacs icon file.")

(defconst psimacs/config/license-file-name "LICENSE"
  "The psimacs license file.")

(defconst psimacs/config/custom-file-name "custom.el"

(defconst psimacs/config/site-lisp-folder "site-lisp"
  "The psimacs site-lisp directory.")

(defconst psimacs/config/config-folder "config"
  "The psimacs config directory.")

(defvar psimacs/config/byte-compile-config-folder nil
  "If set to true, config directory will be byte-compiled after initialization.
This variable is set during the configuration process.
Do not change it here!
")

(defconst psimacs/config/inhibit-byte-compile-config-folder nil
  "If set to true, config directory will not be byte-compiled.")
 #+END_SRC

*** Garbage collection

Fine tuning the garbage collection after startup initialization.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle early-init.el
;;
;; Psimacs default garbage collection parameters
;;
(defconst psimacs/config/gc-cons-threshold 64MB

#+END_SRC

** Some early optimization settings

- Lexical Scope and binding

  [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Lexical-Binding.html][Lexical Binding]] is condensed to the following quote:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  A lexically-bound variable has /lexical scope/, meaning that any reference to the variable must be located
  textually within the binding construct.
#+END_QUOTE

  Its usage is explained in the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Using-Lexical-Binding.html][Emacs manual]].

Use lexical-binding. [[https://nullprogram.com/blog/2016/12/22/][Why? Explanation]].

=lexical-binding: t= has significant advantages, both in performance and static analysis,
and so it should be used for all future Elisp code. The only reason it's not the default
is because it breaks some old (badly written) code.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle early-init.el
;;
;; Use lexical binding instead of dynamic binding.
;;
(setq-default lexical-binding t)
#+END_SRC

-  Before *Emacs* 27, the init file was responsible for initializing the package manager by calling
  =package-initialize=. *Emacs* 27 changed the default behavior: It now calls =package-initialize= before loading the
  init file. Since we use the =straight= package manager in *Psimacs*, we inhibit the package manager initialization
  at all.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle early-init.el
;;
;; Inhibit the package manager at all
;;
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
#+END_SRC

- Let's inhibit resizing the frame at early stage.

  [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Implied-Frame-Resizing.html][Implied Frame Resizing]]:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  By default, Emacs tries to keep the number of lines and columns of a frame's text area unaltered when, for example,
  toggling its menu or tool bar, changing its default font or setting the width of any of its scroll bars. This means
  that in such case Emacs must ask the window manager to resize the frame's window in order to accommodate the size
  change.

  Occasionally, such implied frame resizing may be unwanted, for example, when a frame has been maximized or made
   full-screen (where it's turned off by default). In general, users can disable implied resizing with the following
  option:
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle early-init.el
;;
;; If this option is nil, changing a frame' font, menu bar, tool bar, internal borders,
;; fringes or scroll bars may resize its outer frame in order to keep the number of
;; columns or lines of its text area unaltered. If this option is t, no such resizing
;; is done.
;;
(setq frame-inhibit-implied-resize t)
#+END_SRC

- Never use the menu-bar, the tool-bar or the scroll-bar:

  It will be faster to disable them here before they've been initialized.

  *Psimacs* does disable these features by default because these items make Emacs really beautiful on every platform.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle early-init.el
;;
;; Beautify Emacs
;;
(menu-bar-mode -1)
(tool-bar-mode -1)
(scroll-bar-mode -1)
(horizontal-scroll-bar-mode -1)
#+END_SRC

- Avoid flickering of the screen

  Set theme colors early. The colors are taken from the alect-colors found in the 'alect-themes.el'.
  If another theme is used on default, these settings should be adapted, accordingly.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle early-init.el
;;
;; Change color to avoid screen flickering
;;
(set-face-foreground 'default "#d0bf8f" nil) ; the alect-dark theme forground color
(set-face-background 'default "#3f3f3f" nil) ; the alect-dark theme background color
#+END_SRC

- Avoid garbage collection at startup

  The GC can easily double startup time, so we suppress it at startup by turning up =gc-cons-threshold=
  and the =gc-cons-percentage= temporarily.

  For detail information read the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Garbage-Collection.html][Garbage Collection manual entry]].

  Later in the initialization process the garbage collection procedure is even more fine tuned.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle early-init.el
;;
;; Garbage collection optimization
;;
(setq gc-cons-threshold  most-positive-fixnum
      ;; The value of this variable is the number of bytes of storage that must
      ;; be allocated for Lisp objects after one garbage collection in order to
      ;; trigger another garbage collection.

      gc-cons-percentage 0.6
      ;; The value of this variable specifies the amount of consing before a
      ;; garbage collection occurs, as a fraction of the current heap size.
)

- Another small optimization concerns on =file-name-handler-alist=

  On every .el and .elc file loaded during start up, it has to runs those regexps against the filename;
  setting it to nil and after initialization finished put the value back make the initialization process quicker.

- Disable warnings generated when functions are redefined with defadvice

  Defines what to do with redefinitions during Advice de/activation.
  Redefinition occurs if a previously activated function that already has an
  original definition associated with it gets redefined and then de/activated.
  In such a case we can either accept the current definition as the new
  original definition, discard the current definition and replace it with the
  old original, or keep it and raise an error. The values `accept', `discard',
  `error' or `warn' govern what will be done. `warn' is just like `accept' but
  it additionally prints a warning message. All other values will be
  interpreted as `error'.

** Tangling support without org-bable

The code generation process is not performed with the [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][Org Mode Babel]] functionality. That is because the startup
should be pretty fast and not rely on loading [[https://orgmode.org][org-mode]] only for this task. Additionally, the tangling function
does do some special stuff that is not supported by the  [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][Org Mode Babel]] framework.

Sections and its subsections that are prefixed with =Canceled= or =Disabled= tokens get filtered out. The
same happens if a section is attributed by the tag =:noexport:=.

Sections that are tagged by =:noexport:= are not exported to html.

*Psimacs* is expected to reside in sub-directory =emacs/psimacs/emacs=. The author uses the same sub-directory
in its home directory and avoids the =.emcad.d= directory completely. Instead the use of environment variable
=XDG_CONFIG_HOME= allows to run various *Emacs* configuration simultaneously.

The following /Windows Batch-File/ is used for starting *Psimacs*:

#+END_SRC

The constant =psimacs/config/dropbox-dir= is the actual /Dropbox/ directory found on your machine. It is determined by
the function =psimacs/config/find-dropbox-folder= at initialization time. The constant
=psimacs/config/dropbox-emacs-dir= is a sub directory to =psimacs/config/dropbox-dir=. For a multiple configuration
setup it should be =emacs/psimacs/emacs=. In a traditional Emacs setup, it would be set to =.emacs.d=.
Other configurations then can exchange the /psimacs/ string to something other.

* Preamble to the /init.el/ file

Until this point, all *Psimacs* source code tangled to the =early-inti.el= file. From now on, the actual configuration
file is setup. It starts with a commentary preamble written to the primary =init.el= file.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Emacs 27 introduces early-init.el, which is run before init.el,
;; before package and UI initialization happens.
;;
#+END_SRC

*Psimacs* splits the configuration into various =init-*.el=-files. This will allow better looking up specific
settings or perform some experimentation. Each of these configuration files will be properly documented and it
is possible to completely relinquish the tangling process and work with the =init-*.el = initialization files
alone.

The main configuration starts now. It is sectioned into different topics. Each topic starts with a prime section
of its own.

* System helpers

This has to be provided early in the initialization process so that it is available for the subsequent code.

** Startup frame size and position

Early up we set the *Psimacs* frame's size and position in order to avoid distracting frame repositioning and resizing.
*Psimacs* provides three simple strategies for positioning and sizing new frames. These strategies can be activated
by the following function which are actually defined in section [[Frame size and position][Frame size and position]].

| Key binding       | Command                                                 | Description                                                                               |
|-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =H-m C-w C-x 5 l= | =M-x psimacs/window/set-frame-creation-strategy-layout= | Place and size new frames left and right to the main frame. This is the default strategy. |
| =H-m C-w C-x 5 m= | =M-x psimacs/window/set-frame-creation-strategy-main=   | Always use the same placement and size as the initial main frame.                         |
| =H-m C-w C-x 5 s= | =M-x psimacs/window/set-frame-creation-strategy-system= | Let Emacs and the operating system decide.                                                |
|-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

If you do not like the =layout= preset, change variable =psimacs/config/default-frame-creation-strategy= according
to it's documentation string.

* Configuration constants

In the following various *Psimacs* configuration constants are defined. They are just defined at a central place, but
used only later in the configuration. This section is rather boring. However, I decided to concentrate
all these settings together so that it is easy to lookup or change them.

** Primary directory

This defines the =site-lisp= directory for storing local elisp code and the dependencies directory where non *Emacs*
programs are installed.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle config/init-constants.el :var file-description="Configuration constants"
;;
;; Directory constants used by Psimacs
;;
(defconst psimacs/config/emacs-dir
  (psimacs/file-system/concat-directory invocation-directory "..")
  "The installation directory of Emacs"
)

(defconst psimacs/config/config-dir
  (psimacs/file-system/concat-directory user-emacs-directory psimacs/config/config-folder)
  "The psimacs config directory.")

(defconst psimacs/config/site-lisp-dir
  (psimacs/file-system/concat-directory user-emacs-directory psimacs/config/site-lisp-folder)
  "The psimacs personal site-lisp directory.")

(defconst psimacs/config/session-dir
  (psimacs/file-system/concat-directory user-emacs-directory "session")
  "The psimacs session directory used for storing various session information.")

(defconst psimacs/config/assets-dir
  (psimacs/file-system/concat-directory user-emacs-directory psimacs/config/assets-folder)
  "The psimacs assets directory.")

(defconst psimacs/config/straight-dir
  (psimacs/file-system/concat-directory user-emacs-directory "straight")
  "The psimacs straight directory.")
#+END_SRC

** Private directory

*Psimacs* uses some optional private information that should not go public. These data are stored in
the following directory.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle config/init-constants.el
;;
;; Private directory and file might exists; not mandatory.
;;
(defconst psimacs/config/private-dir

  (psimacs/file-system/concat-file psimacs/config/private-dir "init-private.el")
  "A directory that contains non public, i.e.  private data."
  )
#+END_SRC

** Tools directory

The tools directory contains non *Emacs* / *Lisp* tools, that are not readily available, but are important for
*Psimacs* configuration. For instance =msys64= is needed by *Psimacs* but an appropriate installation can be provided
by resources from the web. Therefore =msys64= is not found in tools. Goal is it that the =psimacs/config/tools-dir=
is empty.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle config/init-constants.el
;;
;; Installation of 'personal' tools
;;
(defconst psimacs/config/tools-dir
  (psimacs/file-system/concat-directory psimacs/config/site-lisp-dir "tools")
  "The psimac personal tools directory.")
#+END_SRC

** System resources directory

Many dependencies exists to external programs that are used by *Psimacs*. On default most of them are expected
to be installed in the =psimacs/config/system-utils-dir=. For each tool that *Psimacs* expects a detailed installation
recipe is provided.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle config/init-constants.el

#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle config/init-constants.el

;; Constants used by Psimacs for bookmarking

** Emacs client/server

[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Emacs-Server.html][Client/Server]] support for *Psimacs*. We use the default /server/ directory. Since we allow multiple
*Emacs* configurations side by side, we must either set the global environment variable =EMACS_SERVER_FILE=
to the correct server file, or we must call *emacsclient* with option =-f server-file=.

*Psimacs* handles that in the following way:
- *Psimacs* uses the =EMACS_SERVER_FILE=
- If at startup a =EMACS_SERVER_FILE= if already defined in the environment and it does not correspond to
  the current configuration, =EMACS_SERVER_FILE= is not modified and the //*Emacs server*/ is not started.
- If the =EMACS_SERVER_FILE= is not defined, or it points to a non existing file, it is set to the
  current configuration's /server-file/ in the user environment.
  Additionally, a =kill-emacs-hook= is set up that removes the environment variable on exit of the *Emacs* session.

** MSYS2

[[https://www.msys2.org/][MSYS2]] is software distribution and a building platform for Windows.
It provides a Unix-like environment, a command-line interface and a software repository making
it easier to install, use, build and port software on Windows.

It is an independent rewrite of MSys, based on modern Cygwin (POSIX compatibility layer) and
MinGW-w64 with the aim of better interoperability with native Windows software.

*Psimacs* uses a lot of external programs provided by the [[https://www.msys2.org/][MSYS2]] framework.
[[https://www.msys2.org/][MSYS2]] is a collection of tools and libraries providing you with an
easy-to-use environment for building, installing and running native Windows software.

Download the [[https://www.msys2.org/#installation][installer]] for the [[https://www.msys2.org/][MSYS2]] framework and follow the installation instructions. Install into folder
=c:/utils/msys64= which is the default for *Psimacs*. The installation does not need to be entered in the system path
environment. *Psimacs* handles a proper executable path internally. After finishing the base installation some packages
must be installed with the [[https://www.msys2.org/][MSYS2]] package manager /pacman/. For that, open the =MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit= terminal and execute
the following commands:

Remarks:
- In order to get the Windows environment exported to a [[https://www.msys2.org/][MSYS2]] bash shell, you need to change one line in
  file =msys2-shell.cmd= which resides in the root of the [[https://www.msys2.org/][MSYS2]] installation. You will find a commented lines
  =rem set MSYS2_PATH_TYPE=inherit=, which should be =set MSYS2_PATH_TYPE=inherit= if you like to see the Windows
  environment as defined by the Windows =Path= variables.

Some of the packages are not really required but I use them and I would like to memorize my installation procedure
here. So, feel free to only install the packages you require.

Pacman queries the local package database with the =-Q= flag, the sync database with the =-S= flag and the files
database with the =-F= flag. See =pacman -Q --help=, =pacman -S --help= and =pacman -F --help= for the respective
suboptions of each flag.

** Python

[[https://www.python.org/][Python]] is one of my favorite languages. I use the Windows OS [[https://www.python.org/][Python]] installer and not the [[https://www.msys2.org/][MSYS2]] python package.

Installation of the following packages is recommended: autopep8, black, certifi, cmake-language-server, flake8,
ipython, jupyter, mypy, mypy-extensions, pyflakes, pylint, pyls-black, pyls-isort, pyls-mypy, ptvsd, pycodestyle,
pycparser, pydocstyle, pywin32, pywinpty, sphinx

*Psimacs* installation does reference the python tools explicitly. Nevertheless, the Windows OS [[https://www.python.org/][Python]] runtime directory
as well as the Windows OS [[https://www.python.org/][Python]] scripts directory will be added to the environment search path list prior to [[https://www.msys2.org/][MSYS2]]
pathes. Therefore our Windows OS [[https://www.python.org/][Python]] should always be at work.

[[https://git-scm.com/][Git]] is a very important external tool to be installed. *Psimacs* uses the [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][Straight]] package manager which relies on a
properly installed [[https://git-scm.com/][Git]] program. A portable version is available at from their [[https://git-scm.com/download/win][download site]].

* Package management

In this section some security measures are configured and the package manager is initialized.

** Making Emacs secure

Some safety tips regarding your editor are covered in the excellent article [[https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2015/11/editor-malware.html][Your Text Editor is Malware]].
So, before going on with the configuration, let's get some things straight. First of all, enable checking
trust on TLS connections.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle config/init-secure.el :var file-description="Secure Emacs"
(setq tls-checktrust t)
#+END_SRC

*Emacs* is now no able to fetch HTTPS anymore! Emacs does not distribute trust root certificates.
We have to solve this problem. The [[https://www.python.org/][Python]] package [[https://pypi.org/project/certifi/][certifi]] /provides Mozilla's carefully curated collection of
Root Certificates for validating the trustworthiness of SSL certificates while verifying the identity of TLS hosts./
The [[https://www.python.org/][Python]] package [[https://pypi.org/project/certifi/][certifi]] should be installed by =pip install certifi=. The following [[https://gitlab.com/DiegoVicente/my-emacs/-/tree/master/][code snippet from Diego Vicente]]
allows the evaluation of the generated trustfile.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle config/init-secure.el
;;
;; With curtsy to https://gitlab.com/DiegoVicente/my-emacs/-/tree/master/
;;
(let
    (
     (trustfile
      (replace-regexp-in-string
       "\\\\" "/"
       (replace-regexp-in-string
        "\n" ""
        ;; requires "pip install certifi"
        (shell-command-to-string (concat psimacs/config/python-runtime-exe " -m certifi"))))
      )
     )

  (setq tls-program (list (format
                           "gnutls-cli%s --x509cafile %s -p %%p %%h"
                           (if (eq window-system 'w32) ".exe" "") trustfile)))

  ;;(message "%s" trustfile)
  ;;(message "%s" tls-program)

  (setq gnutls-verify-error t)
  (setq gnutls-trustfiles (list trustfile))
)
#+END_SRC

It is important to have added MELPA as an HTTPS site for this secure configuration to work.

** Straight package manager

*Psimacs* uses the [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][Straight]] package manager. Note that this package manager depends on [[https://git-scm.com/][Git]].

*** Bootstrap straight.el

To get running at all, the [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][Straight]] package must be installed itself. The code is taken from the [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][Straight]]
/Getting Started/ section.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle config/init-package-manager.el :var file-description="Package manager"

;;
(defvar bootstrap-version)
(let (
        (bootstrap-file (expand-file-name "straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el" user-emacs-directory))
        (bootstrap-version 5)
    )
    (unless (file-exists-p bootstrap-file)
        (with-current-buffer
            (url-retrieve-synchronously
                "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raxod502/straight.el/develop/install.el"
                'silent 'inhibit-cookies
            )
            (goto-char (point-max))

*** use-package
Replace =use-package= automatically by =straight-use-package= in our configuration.

[[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] is a macro that provides convenient syntactic sugar for many common tasks
related to installing and configuring *Emacs* packages. Of course, it does not actually
install the packages, but instead defers to a package manager, like [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][Straight]].

To use use-package, first install it with [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][Straight]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle config/init-package-manager.el
;;
;; To use use-package, first install it with straight.el
;;
(straight-use-package 'use-package)
#+END_SRC

Now =use-package= will use [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][Straight]] to automatically install missing packages if you provide =:straight t=.

Customize =straight-use-package-by-default= to make it so that =:straight t= is assumed unless you explicitly
override it with =:straight nil=.

Specifying =:straight t= is unnecessary if you set =straight-use-package-by-default= to a non-nil value.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle config/init-package-manager.el
;;
;; No more ':straight t' necessary anymore
;;
(setq straight-use-package-by-default t)
#+END_SRC

Any code that relates to /[[https://wikemacs.org/wiki/Package.el][package.el]]/ should be removed; for example, references to =package-initialize=,
=package-archives=, and (if you're using =use-package=) =:ensure= or =use-package-always-ensure=.

While it is technically possible to use both  /[[https://wikemacs.org/wiki/Package.el][package.el]]/ and [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][Straight]] at the same time, there is no real
reason to, and it might result in oddities like packages getting loaded more than once.

Out of the box, you can install any package listed on [[https://melpa.org/#/][MELPA]], [[https://elpa.gnu.org/][GNU ELPA]], or [[https://github.com/emacsmirror][Emacsmirror]], which is to say any
package in existence. (Although  [[https://melpa.org/#/][MELPA]] is used as a package listing, packages are installed by cloning their
[[https://git-scm.com/][Git]] repositories rather than by downloading tarballs like /[[https://wikemacs.org/wiki/Package.el][package.el]]/ does.)

If the package or your configurations aren't being loaded, you probably have something wrong with your
usage of =:init= and =:config=. By default, the behavior of =use-package= is inconsistent:
You must set either =use-package-always-defer= (override with =:demand t=) or =use-package-always-demand=
(override with =:defer t=) to set a default for whether evaluating a =use-package= form will load the
package and your configurations.

If you've set a package to be deferred, you then need to make sure there's a way for it to get loaded when
needed, for example by means of an autoload (either provided by the package, or set up automatically
by =use-package= via =:bind=, or set up manually through =use-package= via =:commands=) or by an explicit
require in one of your custom commands.

If you do want to start optimizing your startup, you will likely end up using just =:hook= for mode triggered
loading and =:defer t= for command triggered loading!

** Measuring the startup performance

*** Print the startup time

            (format "%.2f seconds"
                (float-time (time-subtract after-init-time before-init-time))
            )
            gcs-done)
    )

#+END_SRC

*** Detail startup benchmarking

This is a simple benchmark of calls to *Emacs* /require/ and /load/ functions. It can be used to keep track
of where time is being spent during *Emacs* startup in order to optimize startup times.

Usage: The following commands and functions can be used to govern the benchmarking.


| =benchmark-init/show-durations-tabulated= |
| =benchmark-init/show-durations-tree=      |
|                                           |
| =benchmark-init/activate=                 |
| =benchmark-init/deactivate=               |


Using =:defer N= with an integer is for a rare scenario where you do want the package to always be unconditionally
loaded on startup (and not reactively as the result of a file mode or executed command) and want to kick it out by
a few seconds to technically save some startup time.

I personally don't recommend this since it's not going to speed up your actual "time to full functionality," but
instead just improve a narrowly defined metric of "startup time."

*** Use the garbage collector magic hack

Enforce a sneaky Garbage Collection strategy to minimize GC interference with the activity.

During normal use a high GC threshold is set. When idling GC is immediately triggered and a low threshold is set.

*** Process data exchange
Basically, this is an optimization with respect to the data exchange between [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/][Language Server Protocol]] servers and
its clients.

[[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/][lsp-mode: Language Server Protocol Support for Emacs]], aims to provide IDE-like experience by providing optional
integration with the most popular *Emacs* packages like [[https://company-mode.github.io/][company]], [[https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/][flycheck]] and [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][projectile]].

Increase the amount of data which *Emacs* reads from the process. Again the *Emacs* default is too low 4K

*** How to type C-@ on a German Windows keyboard

Emacs keys may seem to be /hidden/ because MS Windows implements =AltGr= as =Alt + Left Control=.
Therefore key bindings such as =C-@= are quite difficult to type.

Solutions:
- Using the right control key

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The trick is that you must type =AltGr= as the first key, and =Ctrl= must be the right control key,
  not the left one.
#+END_QUOTE

- Using =C-SPC= instead of =C-@=

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  It turns out that instead of =C-@= you can always type =C-SPC=.
#+END_QUOTE

*** Base configuration of the keyboard

Basically, we stay with the default *Emacs* keyboard configuration. We swallow the =<lwindow>=, =<rwindow>= and =<apps>=
keys as far as possible. We will use them for =super= and =<hyper>= prefix keys for *Psimacs* own key bindings.

** Hydra

The package [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][hydra]] can be used to tie related commands into a family of short key bindings with a
common prefix - a /hydra/.

*Psimacs* provides many /hydras/ that gives another usage pattern of *Emacs*. All global /hydras/ are
conveniently accessible through bindings =H-SPC= or =s-SPC=. All *Psimacs* hydras commands start with string
=psimacs/hydra/=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle config/init-basic-system.el
;;
;; Early load the hydra package.
;;
(use-package hydra)
#+END_SRC

In addition *Psimacs* installs the package [[https://gitlab.com/to1ne/use-package-hydra][use-package-hydra]] which provides =:hydra= keyword for =use-package=.
This allows the the definition of a single [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][hydra]] or a list of [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][hydras]] with the same arguments that as =defhydra=
does.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle config/init-basic-system.el

|-----------------+----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------|

For the =print-*= commands to function, I was forced to do some extra work outside of *Emacs*. The reason is that
I am using a network printer with its own IP address. IMHO, *Emacs* does not handle this situation out of the box.
At first I followed the [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MsWindowsNetworkPrinter][Ms Windows Network Printer]] instructions. That basically work for me. However, I discovered
that I just need to share my printer and then call the following =shell-command= to create a virtual printer
port /LPT3/:

#+BEGIN_SRC
net use LPT3: "\\127.0.0.1\EPSON ET-4750 Series"
#+END_SRC

I simply integrated this call into my =psimacs.cmd= command and set the =printer-name= to the virtual printer
port /LPT3/ in the configuration.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle config/init-basic-system.el
;;
;; Support for the printer-* commands

For the =ps-print-*= commands to work I needed to install [[https://www.ghostscript.com/][Ghostscript]]. First I tried the [[https://www.msys2.org/][MSYS2]] which I was not able
to get working correctly. Therefore I tried the 64 Bit [[https://www.ghostscript.com/download/gsdnld.html][Windows installer]] from the [[https://www.ghostscript.com/][Ghostscript]] download site. This worked
perfectly. In order to set this up I followed the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Windows-Printing.html][Printing and MS-Windows]] *Emacs* manual instructions.

*** A file system library named f.el

[[https://github.com/rejeep/f.el][f]] is a [[https://github.com/rejeep/f.el][file system library]] that provides lots of =f-name= functions for easing file system programming tasks.
Basically it provides a modern API for working with files and directories in *Emacs*.

*** Alert an alternative notification interface

Just use [[https://github.com/jwiegley/alert][alert]] instead of message to get a stylized customizable notification interface for *Emacs*.

Usage exaples:

| =(alert "This is an alert")=                                    |
| =(alert "This is an alert" :severity 'high)=                    |

** Customizations

*Psimacs* uses a special file =custom.el= that it uses for writing customization code.
That should avoid always changing the =init.el= file.

You can always create a /custom-file/ by running command =customize-save-customized=.

References about customization:

** Encoding system

I am in no means an expert in Encoding systems. I have not studied all the variables floating in encoding soup.
Below you find the encoding settings that I have in use. Probably this is to much or even wrong. Sorry, for
that.

** Emacs server

[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Emacs-Server.html][Using Emacs as a Server]] describes the details about configuration of an *Emacs server*. *Psimacs* uses a configuration
method that allows multiple different *Emacs's* be run simultaneously. However, only one can drive the *Emacs server*
at a time. *Psimacs* is configured in such a way that is starts the server only if no other *Emacs* instance exists
that does already run the server. /First come first serve/ principle. For that it uses the =EMACS_SERVER_FILE=
environment variable for server detection. If it is actually, the first one it sets the =EMACS_SERVER_FILE= variable
accordingly.

Caveat: This is only Windows OS specific and I do not know how to setup that on other systems.

*** Smooth Scrolling

The [[https://github.com/aspiers/smooth-scrolling][smooth-scrolling]] package offers a minor mode which make emacs scroll smoothly. It keeps the point away from
the top and bottom of the current buffer's window in order to keep lines of context around the point visible as
much as possible, whilst minimising the frequency of sudden scroll jumps which are visually confusing.

You can toggle the  [[https://github.com/aspiers/smooth-scrolling][smooth-scrolling-mode]] with the following command.

*** Mark and Pop

Immediately after you type =C-u C-SPC=, you can type =C-SPC= instead of =C-u C-SPC= to

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Each buffer remembers previous locations of the mark, in the mark ring. Commands that set the mark also push the old
mark onto this ring. One of the uses of the mark ring is to remember spots that you may want to go back to.

*** Unicode fonts

The package [[https://github.com/rolandwalker/unicode-fonts][unicode-fonts]] provides font mappings in the Unicode 8.0 standard.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Emacs maintains font mappings on a per-glyph basis, meaning that multiple fonts are used at the
same time (transparently) to display any character for which you have a font. Furthermore, Emacs
does this out of the box.

However, font mappings via fontsets are a bit difficult to configure. In addition, the default
setup does not always pick the most legible fonts. As the manual warns, the choice of font actually
displayed for a non-ASCII character is "somewhat random".

The Unicode standard provides a way to organize font mappings: it divides character ranges into
logical groups called "blocks". This library configures Emacs in a Unicode-friendly way by providing mappings from
each Unicode block to a font with good coverage and makes the settings available via the customization
interface.

This library provides font mappings for 233 of the 255 blocks in the Unicode 8.0 standard which are
public and have displayable characters. It assumes that 6 Latin blocks are covered by the default font.
16/255 blocks are not mapped to any known font.

A couple of good looking themes are assembled in the configuration. Currently the
/alect-dark/ theme is active on start up. The theme can be changed at runtime with
the commands =load-theme=, =enable-theme= and =disable-theme=.

The following themes are my favorites currently:

| Theme                         |
|-------------------------------|
| =alect-dark=                  |
| =alect-light-alt=             |
| =sanityinc-tomorrow-eighties= |
| =moe-dark=                    |
|-------------------------------|

For the time being, the =alect-dark= is active in my configuration.

** Prettify

*Emacs* ships with a minor mode called [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/progmodes/prog-mode.el][prettify-symbols-mode]]. Its purpose is to replace the standard text
representation of various identifiers/symbols with a (arguably) more aesthetically pleasing representation
(often a single unicode character would replace several ascii characters).

A classic example would be lambda from various Lisp dialects that many people prefer to replace with the
greek letter λ (small lambda).

Another package is [[https://github.com/pretty-mode/pretty-mode][pretty-mode]] which provides basically the same features. This package additionally provides
category groups for activation of different usage patterns.

Unfortunately problems arise when mixing  [[https://github.com/pretty-mode/pretty-mode][pretty-mode]] with [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/progmodes/prog-mode.el][prettify-symbols-mode]] so that it is not possible
to facilitate the  [[https://github.com/pretty-mode/pretty-mode][pretty-mode]] categories.

Therefore *Psimacs* defines all symbols from scratch with [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/progmodes/prog-mode.el][prettify-symbols-mode]].

*** Pretty-Mode :noexport:

[[https://github.com/pretty-mode/pretty-mode][Pretty-mode]] redisplays parts of the Emacs buffer as pretty Unicode symbols.

This section is only added for documentation purpose, but it should not be used.

*** Prettify-Symbols-Mode

When [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/progmodes/prog-mode.el][prettify-symbols-mode]] and  [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Font-Lock.html][font-locking]] are enabled, symbols are prettified. *Psimacs* defines list of symbols
for various programming modes.

Currently the greek characters are supported for all programming modes and additionally some extra symbols are
defined for the Python programming mode.

*** Emojis in Buffers

[[https://github.com/iqbalansari/emacs-emojify][Emojify]] is an Emacs extension to display emojis.
It can display github style emojis like =:smile:= or plain ascii ones like =:)=. It tries to be
as efficient as possible, while also providing a lot of flexibility.

*** Rainbow delimiters

The package [[https://github.com/Fanael/rainbow-delimiters][rainbow-delimiters]] highlights delimiters such as parentheses, brackets or braces according to their depth.
Each successive level is highlighted in a different color. This makes it easy to spot

*** A minor-mode menu for the mode line

The package [[https://github.com/tarsius/minions][Minion]] implements a menu that lists enabled minor-modes,
as well as commonly but not currently enabled minor-modes. It can be used to toggle local and global
minor-modes, to access mode-specific menus, and to get help about modes.

** Backups

*Psimacs* does make backups, uses auto saving and provides minibuffer histories.

*** Backups

*Psimacs* uses a central [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Backup.html#Backup][backup]] directory. I like to have a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Backup.html#Backup][backup]] on each save and with the correct relative
path below of my central backup directory. Each new backup file is created by appending a '~' character to
the orginal file name. If this file already exists in the backup location then this file is itself renamed
etc. until we can rename our original file. All backup files that are older than one week will be removed
at startup.

*** Auto-Save

[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Auto-Save.html#Auto-Save][Autosave]] automatically saves each visited file in a separate file, without altering the file you actually use.
It uses a central [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Auto-Save.html#Auto-Save][auto-save]] directory for that.

auto-save-mode.

** Handling

This section provides setting and packages that enhance the user experience with *Emacs* considerably.

*** Undo-Redo

The package [[https://gitlab.com/ideasman42/emacs-undo-fu][undo-fu]] provides a simple, stable linear undo with redo for *Emacs*.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This is a light weight wrapper for Emacs built-in undo system,
adding convenient undo/redo without losing access to the full undo history,
allowing you to visit all previous states of the document if you need.
The changes compared Emacs undo are as follows:
- Redo will not pass the initial undo action.
- Redo will not undo (unlike Emacs redo which traverses previous undo/redo steps).
- These constraints can be temporarily disabled by pressing =C-g= before undo or redo.

Note that this doesn't interfere with Emacs internal undo data, which can be error prone.
#+END_QUOTE


#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The default Emacs undo has two limitations this package aims to resolve,
- Two actions are required to initiate redo.
- It's easy to accidentally redo past the point where undo started
  making it inconvenient to restore the document to the point when undo began.
#+END_QUOTE

| Key binding | Command                     | Description                                   |

*Psimacs* do not change the default bindings for the =describe-= commands. Instead the [[https://github.com/Wilfred/helpful][helpful]] commands are
provided in the additional =H-h= key map for help topics.

*** Edit region indirectly in another buffer

The package [[https://github.com/Fanael/edit-indirect][edit-indirect]] is a useful enhancement for editing. It provides a command =edit-indirect-region= that
allows the editing of a region in a separate buffer.

The region is copied, without text properties, to a separate buffer, called *edit-indirect buffer*. The major
is guessed.

After finishing the editing the command =edit-indirect-commit= replaces the original region with the content of
the *edit-indirect buffer*. Alternatively, the command =edit-indirect-abort= drops the modification and leaves the
region unchanged. Very useful!

*** First errors in compilation buffer

[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Compilation.html][Running Compilations under Emacs]] describes a useful variable that allows that scrolling of the compilation output

*** Apropos

Each of the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Apropos.html][apropos]] commands reads an apropos pattern in the minibuffer, searches for items that match the pattern,

overrides *Emacs*'s default mechanism for making buffer names unique (using suffixes like <2>, <3> etc.)
with a more sensible behavior which use parts of the file names to make the buffer names distinguishable.

**** Automatically insert matching bracket :noexport:

When on, typing any left bracket automatically insert the right matching bracket. This is accomplished by *Emacs*'s
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Matching.html][electric-pair-mode]].

At the moment I have disabled it, because I would like to try [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs.html][Xah Lee]] alternative to the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Matching.html][electric-pair-mode]].
Actually, I always had some problems with the  [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Matching.html][electric-pair-mode]].

**** Insert brackets by pair

The following code [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/elisp_insert_brackets_by_pair.html][Emacs: Insert Brackets by Pair]] is taken from [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs.html][Xah Lee]]. It tries to solve some of the

  "Insert brackets around selection, word, at point, and maybe move cursor in between.

 ,*left-bracket and *right-bracket are strings.
 ,*wrap-method must be either 'line or 'block. 'block means between empty lines.

• if there's a region, add brackets around region.
• if *wrap-method is 'line, wrap around line.
• if *wrap-method is 'block, wrap around block.
• if cursor is at beginning of line and its not empty line and contain at least 1 space, wrap around the line.
• if cursor is at end of a word or buffer, one of the following will happen:
        xyz▮ → xyz(▮)
        xyz▮ → (xyz▮) if in one of the lisp modes.
• wrap brackets around word if any. e.g. xy▮z → (xyz▮). Or just (▮)

**** Smart parenthesis

The package [[https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens][smartparens]] is minor mode for *Emacs* that deals with /parens pairs/ and tries to be smart about them.

*Psimacs* does have the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Matching.html#Matching][show-paren-mode]] active on default. With the command =M-x psimacs/activate/toggle-smartparens-paren-mode=
which is bound to =H-m C-p C-s t= you can easily toggle between global [[https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens][smartparens-mode]] and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Matching.html#Matching][show-paren-mode]].

*** Buffer List

Use command =ibuffer= instead of the default =list-buffers= for =C-x C-b=. The command =ibuffer= is an improved
version of =list-buffers=. *IBuffer* colors the files by type and [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs.html][Xah Lee]] introduces it in [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_buffer_management.html][Emacs: List Buffers]].

| Key binding | Command                | Description                                    |
|-------------+------------------------+------------------------------------------------|
| =C-x C-b=   | =M-x ibuffer=          | Begin using IBuffer to edit a list of buffers. |
| =C-x b=     | =M-x switch-to-buffer= | Switch to buffer, selected from list.          |
| =C-x k=     | =M-x kill-buffer=      | Close the current buffer.                      |
|             |                        |                                                |

*** Cua Mode

When [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/CUA-Bindings.html][CUA mode]] is enabled, the keys =C-x=, =C-c=, =C-v=, and =C-z= invoke commands that cut (kill),
copy, paste (yank), and undo respectively.

To enter an *Emacs* command like =C-x C-f= while the mark is active, use one of the following
methods:
- either hold Shift together with the prefix key, e.g., =S-C-x C-f=,
- or quickly type the prefix key twice, e.g., =C-x C-x C-f=
- or disable [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/CUA-Bindings.html][CUA mode]] by pressing =<f12>= or =H-m c=.

[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/CUA-Bindings.html][CUA mode]] provides enhanced rectangle support with visible rectangle highlighting.
Use =C-RET= to start a rectangle, extend it using the movement commands, and cut or copy
it using =C-x= or =C-c=. =RET= moves the cursor to the next (clockwise) corner of the rectangle,
so you can easily expand it in any direction. Normal text you type is inserted to the left
or right of each line in the rectangle (on the same side as the cursor).

With CUA you can easily copy text and rectangles into and out of registers by providing a
one-digit numeric prefix to the kill, copy, and yank commands, e.g., =C-1 C-c= copies the
region into register 1, and =C-2 C-v= yanks the contents of register 2.

CUA mode also has a global mark feature which allows easy moving and copying of text
between buffers. Use =C-S-SPC= to toggle the global mark on and off. When the global
mark is on, all text that you kill or copy is automatically inserted at the global
mark, and text you type is inserted at the global mark rather than at the current
position.

*** Perspective

The [[https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el][perspective]] package provides multiple named workspaces
(or "perspectives") in *Emacs*, similar to multiple desktops in window managers.

Each [[https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el][perspective]] has its own buffer list and its own window
layout. This makes it easy to work on many separate projects without getting lost in all the buffers.
Switching to a [[https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el][perspective]] activates its window configuration,
and when in a [[https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el][perspective]], only its buffers
are available (by default).

Each *Emacs* frame has a distinct list of [[https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el][perspectives]].

Commands are all prefixed by =C-x x= by default. To change the prefix key, customize =persp-mode-prefix-key=.
Additionally, creating a key binding for =persp-mode-map= will also activate the prefix.

Since [[https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el][perspective]]  maintains distinct buffer lists for each [[https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el][perspective]], it helps to use a
Perspective-aware buffer switcher.

Currently, *Psimacs* has not enabled [[https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el][perspective]] on default. I have to think about its usefulness for my working habit.

*** Abbreviations

*Emacs's* [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Abbrevs.html][Abbrevs]] feature lets you type a short word and expand into a full word or code template.

Emacs has a nice feature to expand abbreviations. If for example, you wanted
an abbreviation for 'Your Name' to be 'yn', just type 'yn' and with your point
after the 'n' do =C-x a i g= (mnemonic add inverse global) and enter the expansion,
in this case 'Your Name'. In the future, whenever you type 'yn' your name will be
inserted. The abbrevs are automatically saved between sessions in a file.

If you don't like an abbrev that you have set up, then do =M-x edit-abbrevs=.
You can have different abbrevs for each mode (cperl, c++, Message);
the g in =C-x a i g= is for global, meaning every mode.

Suppose you want to define "bg" for "background": Type =M-x add-global-abbrev=, i.e. =C-x a g= and
then type "bg" in the prompt. Now, when you type "bg" followed by a space or return, it will expand
to "background".

If you want the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Abbrevs.html][abbrev]] only
for the current major mode: Type =M-x add-mode-abbrev=, i.e. =C-x a l= ...

If the expanded text is more than one word, for example, suppose you want to define "faq" for
"frequently asked questions". Type "frequently asked questions", then select the text and do
=C-u C-x a g= rspl. =C-u C-x a l=.

Remove an abbreviation by =C-u -1 C-x a g= rspl. =C-u -1 C-x a l= followed by the memnomic, e.g. "bg".

Other commands: =M-x list-abbrevs=, =M-x edit-abbrevs=, =M-x edit-abbrevs-redefine=, =M-x abbrev-edit-save-buffe=
and =M-x abbrev-edit-save-to-file=.

Additionally, =M-x read-abbrev-file= and =M-x write-abbrev-file=.

*** Large File Support

[[https://github.com/m00natic/vlfi][VLF]] is a *Emacs* minor mode that allows viewing, editing, searching and comparing large files
in batches, trading memory for processor time. Batch size can be adjusted on the fly
and bounds the memory that is to be used for operations on the file. This way multiple
large files (like terabytes or whatever) can be instantly and simultaneously accessed
without swapping and degraded performance.

*** Easy window switching

The package [[https://github.com/abo-abo/ace-window][ace-window]] allows easy window switching.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
When there are two windows, [[https://github.com/abo-abo/ace-window][ace-window]] will call
=other-window=. If there are more, each window will have the first character of its window
label highlighted at the upper left of the window. Pressing that character will either switch
to that window or filter to the next character needed to select a specific window.
Note that, unlike [[https://github.com/winterTTr/ace-jump-mode][ace-jump-mode]], the position
of point will not be changed, i.e. the same   behavior as that of =other-window=.

*** Winner Mode

[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Window-Convenience.html][winner-mode]] lets you use
=C-c <left>= and =C-c <right>= to switch between window configurations. This is handy when something has popped
up a buffer that you want to look at briefly before returning to whatever you were working on.
When you're done, press =C-c <left>=.

** Basic Tools

*** Ediff

The [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/ediff.html][Ediff]] package provides a
comprehensive visual interface to Unix diff and patch utilities.

From the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/ediff.html][Ediff Introduction]]
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Ediff provides a convenient way for simultaneous browsing through the differences between a pair
(or a triple) of files or buffers. The files being compared, file-A, file-B, and file-C are shown
in separate windows (side by side, one above the another, or in separate frames), and the
differences are highlighted as you step through them.
You can also copy difference regions from one buffer to another (and recover old differences
if you change your mind).

Another powerful feature is the ability to merge a pair of files into a third buffer.
Merging with an ancestor file, (a.k.a. 3way merges) is also supported. Furthermore,
Ediff is equipped with directory-level capabilities that allow the user to conveniently
launch browsing or merging sessions on groups of files in two (or three) different directories.

In addition, Ediff can apply a patch to a file and then let you step through both files, the
patched and the original one, simultaneously, difference-by-difference.

Remarks:
- All Ediff commands are displayed in a Quick Help window, unless you type =?= to shrink the window to just one line. You can redisplay the help window by typing =?= again.
- Many Ediff commands take numeric prefix arguments.
- Some commands take negative prefix arguments as well.
- Without the prefix argument, all commands operate on the currently selected difference region.

*** Visible Bookmarks

The package [[https://github.com/joodland/bm][Visible bookmarks]] provides visible, buffer local, bookmarks and the
ability to jump forward and backward to the next bookmark. They are quite similar to the /MS Visual Studio/ bookmarks
I am used to.

*** HTMLize

The [[https://github.com/hniksic/emacs-htmlize][htmlize]] package converts the buffer text and the associated decorations to HTML.

To use it, just switch to the buffer you want HTML-ized and type =M-x htmlize-buffer=.
You will be switched to a new buffer that contains the resulting HTML code. You can
edit and inspect this buffer, or you can just save it with =C-x C-w=.
=M-x htmlize-file= will find a file, fontify it, and save the HTML version in FILE.html,
without any additional intervention. =M-x htmlize-many-files= allows you to htmlize any
number of files in the same manner. =M-x htmlize-many-files-dired= does the same for files
marked in a dired buffer.

This support package is used by [[https://orgmode.org][org-mode]] to produce colored htmls.

*** Multiple Cursors

[[https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el][Multiple-cursors]] is a very nice package that lets you create several cursors that all
do the same thing as you type.

**** Visualize Regexp

The package [[https://github.com/benma/visual-regexp.el][visual-regexp]] provides the same functionality
like *Emacs*'s command =replace-regexp=, but with live visual feedback directly in the buffer

**** Visualize Regexp Steroids

The package [[https://github.com/benma/visual-regexp-steroids.el][visual-regexp-steroids]]
is an extension to package [[https://github.com/benma/visual-regexp.el][visual-regexp]]
which enables the use of modern regexp engines (no more escaped group parentheses, and other goodies!).

In addition to that, you can optionally use the better regexp syntax to power
=isearch-forward-regexp= and =isearch-backward-regexp=.

For now, [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html][Python]] and [[https://github.com/joddie/pcre2el][pcre2el]]
are supported out of the box.

** Language support

This section treat some tools for written language spell and grammar checking. Additionally, access is gained
to some translation facilities on the web.

*** Spell checking with Flyspell and Aspell or Hunspell

[[http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Manuel.Serrano/flyspell/flyspell.html][Flyspell]] enables on-the-fly spell checking in Emacs by the means of a minor mode. [[http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Manuel.Serrano/flyspell/flyspell.html][Flyspell]] highlights incorrect words
as soon as they are completed or as soon as the cursor hits a new word.

Basically two spell checker programs are usable. At first there is [[http://aspell.net/][Aspell]] and secondly there is [[https://github.com/hunspell/hunspell][hunspell]]. *Psimacs*
supports both backends. You can configure which one to use with the flag variable =psimacs/internal/spell-checker-use-aspell=.
If this is set to =t= the [[http://aspell.net/][Aspell]] program will be used.

The following key bindings are defined for the spell checking mode.

*** Google translate

The package [[https://github.com/atykhonov/google-translate][google-translate]] allows to translate the strings using [[https://translate.google.com/?hl=de][Google Translate Service]] directly from *Emacs*.
*Psimacs* pre defines the query language to /German/ and the target laguage to /English/ in variable
=google-translate-translation-directions-alist=. If you do not like that setting, change it as it pleases you.

*Psimacs* binds the =M-x google-translate-smooth-translate= command that allows easy translation between the
language pairs provided in the =google-translate-translation-directions-alist= variable. You can toggle between
these pairs with =C-n= and =C-p=.

On default, *Psimacs* outputs the result of the translation process to a separate 'translation buffer'. It then
puts the input focus into that buffer. That can easily be changed to output directly into the current buffer
by calling function =psimacs/spell/google-tanslate/toggle-output-destination=.

*** Counsel-Web

The package [[https://github.com/mnewt/counsel-web][counsel-web]] is an alternative to [[https://github.com/Malabarba/emacs-google-this][google-this]] for searching the Web.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Search the web with dynamic suggestions and browse the results – all from the comfort of Emacs and ivy.

The main idea in [[https://github.com/mnewt/counsel-web][counsel-web]] is to not have to browse search results in a browser–instead go directly
to the page you were searching for.

** Edit multiple regions

The package [[https://github.com/victorhge/iedit][iedit]] provides two *Emacs* minor modes
=iedit-mode= and =iedit-rectangle-mode= and allows you to edit one occurrence of some text
in a buffer (possibly narrowed) or region, and simultaneously have other occurrences edited
in the same way, with visual feedback as you type.

** Easy duplicate

The package [[https://github.com/ongaeshi/duplicate-thing][duplicate-thing]] provides functionality
that allows you to /duplicate whatever's marked/, i.e. easy duplication of line or region, with comment out.

Duplicate line or region N times.
- If it has active mark, it will expand the selection and duplicate it.
- If it doesn't have active mark, it will select current line and duplicate it.

* Utility Lisp functions

All functions defined in *Psimacs* are prefixed by =psimacs/category=. For example
the /string/ related function /starts-with/ is defined as =psimacs/string/starts-with=.

** String processing

Utiltiy functions that help with handling of strings.

The following simple string functions are part of the configuration for historical reason. Today, the build-in *Emacs*
functions for string processing should be used instead.

* Advanced Setup

Now that the basic setup is finished we can take credit of the enormous amount of useful *Emacs* packages out
there. It is one of *Psimacs* goals to be a /modern/ editor. Let's see...

** Helm

*Psimacs* uses the [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][Helm]] as well as the [[https://oremacs.com/swiper/][Ivy]] / [[https://oremacs.com/swiper/][Counsel]] framework. It is more focused towards the [[https://oremacs.com/swiper/][Ivy]] / [[https://oremacs.com/swiper/][Counsel]]
tools none the less. They both can be used side by side. In *Psimacs*, however [[https://oremacs.com/swiper/][Ivy]] / [[https://oremacs.com/swiper/][Counsel]] takes preference.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][Helm]] is an *Emacs* framework for incremental completions and narrowing selections. It provides an easy-to-use
API for developers wishing to build their own Helm applications in Emacs, powerful search tools and dozens of
already built-in commands providing completion to almost everything. It is a must-have for anyone using *Emacs*
as a main work environment.

** Discoverability

*Emacs* is quite a complicated beast that is not easy to get acquainted with. Fortunately, few packages are available
that mitigate the learning curve. The following packages let you /discover/ key bindings, modes etc.

*** Discover Major Mode

Package [[https://framagit.org/steckerhalter/discover-my-major][discover-my-major]] allows to discover key bindings and descriptions for commands defined by a buffer's
major and minor modes.

| Key binding   | Command                 | Description                                                     |
|---------------+-------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| =H-h C-d m=   | =M-x discover-my-major= | Create a listing of all major-mode keys with their description. |
| =H-h C-d M=   | =M-x discover-my-mode=  | Create a listing of all MODE keys with their description.       |
|---------------+-------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle config/init-advanced-discoverability.el :var file-description="Advanced discoverability setup"
;;
;; Discover key bindings and descriptions for commands defined by a buffer
;;
(use-package discover-my-major
    :bind (
        :map psimacs/config/global-key-map/help
            ("C-d m" . discover-my-major)
            ("C-d M" . discover-my-mode)
        )
)
#+END_SRC

*** Helm-Descbinds

*The package [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm-descbinds][helm-descbinds]] provides an interface to *Emacs's* =describe-bindings= making the currently active key
bindings interactively searchable with helm.

| Key binding | Command              | Description                                                 |
|-------------+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------|
| =H-h H-h b= | =M-x helm-descbinds= | Create a listing of all key bindings of current major mode. |
|-------------+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------|

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle config/init-advanced-discoverability.el
;;
;; Provide a searchable list of bindings in current major-mode
;;
(use-package helm-descbinds
  :bind (
         :map psimacs/config/global-key-map/help
         ("H-h b" . helm-descbinds)
         )
  :config
  (helm-descbinds-mode)
  )
#+END_SRC

*** Helm-Describe-Modes

The package [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm-describe-modes][helm-describe-modes]] provides a Helm interface to *Emacs's* =describe-mode=. It lists the major mode,
active minor modes, and inactive minor modes using Helm, and provides actions for each mode.

| Key binding | Command                   | Description                                          |
|-------------+---------------------------+------------------------------------------------------|
| =H-h H-h m= | =M-x helm-describe-modes= | Create a listing of all modes of current major mode. |
|-------------+---------------------------+------------------------------------------------------|

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle config/init-advanced-discoverability.el

;; Provide a searchable list of bindings in current major-mode
;;
(use-package helm-describe-modes
  :bind (
         :map psimacs/config/global-key-map/help
         ("H-h m" . helm-describe-modes)
         )
;  :config
;  (helm-descbinds-mode)
  )
#+END_SRC

*** Which Key

[[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][Which-key]] is a minor mode for *Emacs* that
displays the key bindings following your currently entered incomplete command (a prefix)
in a popup. IMHO, this package is one of the most useful packages for *Emacs*.

| Key binding     | Command                                   | Description                                   |
|-----------------+-------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------|
| =H-m C-u C-w t= | =M-x psimacs/which-key/toggle-sort-order= | Toggle the which-key-mode sort order.         |
| =H-m C-u C-w c= | =M-x psimacs/which-key/cycle-sort-order=  | Cycle through the which-key-mode sort orders. |

*** Swiper / Ivy / Counsel

[[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][Swiper]] gives us a really efficient incremental search
with regular expressions and [[https://oremacs.com/swiper/][Ivy]] / [[https://oremacs.com/swiper/][Counsel]]
replace a lot of ido or helms completion functionality

*** Ivy

[[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][Ivy]] is for quick and easy selection from a list. When *Emacs* prompts for a string
from a list of several possible choices, Ivy springs into action to assist in
narrowing and picking the right string from a vast number of choices.

| Key binding | Command                 | Description                                                             |

| =C-c C-S-r= | =M-x ivy-resume=        | Resumes the last Ivy-based completion.                                  |
| =M-y=       | =M-x ivy-next-line=     | In minibuffer, Move cursor vertically down.                             |
| =C-'=       | =M-x ivy-avy=           | Uses avy to select one of the candidates on the current candidate page. |

*** Counsel

To keep concerns separated, Ivy doesn't have a lot of other functionality. That's where  [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][Counsel]] comes in.

[[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][Ivy mode]] ensures that any Emacs command using =completing-read-function=
uses [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy]] for completion.
Counsel takes this further, providing versions of common *Emacs* commands that are customised to make
the best use of [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy]].

** Completion

Text completion is an important tool for efficient editing and programming. *Psimacs* uses the [[http://company-mode.github.io/][company-mode]] instead
of the [[https://github.com/auto-complete/auto-complete][auto-complete]] package.

*** Auto-Complete :noexport:

[[https://github.com/auto-complete/auto-complete][Auto-Complete]] is an intelligent auto-completion
extension for *Emacs*. It extends the standard *Emacs* completion interface and provides an
environment that allows users to concentrate more on their own work.

| Key binding | Command           | Description          |
|-------------+-------------------+----------------------|
| =C-n=       | =M-x ac-next=     | Next completion.     |
| =C-p=       | =M-x ac-previous= | Previous completion. |
| =ESC=       | =M-x ac-stop=     | Abort completion.    |
|-------------+-------------------+----------------------|

Remark: *Psimacs* uses Company-mode for completion. The following code is used for reference only.

*** Company

[[http://company-mode.github.io/][Company]] is a text completion framework for *Emacs*.
The name stands for "complete anything". It uses pluggable back-ends and front-ends to
retrieve and display completion candidates.

It comes with several back-ends such as /Elisp/, /Clang/, /Semantic/, /Eclim/, /Ropemacs/, /Ispell/,
/CMake/, /BBDB/, /YASnippet/, /dabbrev/, /etags/, /gtags/, /files/, /keywords/ and a few others.

**** Company-Box

[[https://github.com/sebastiencs/company-box/][company-box]] provides a [[http://company-mode.github.io/][company]] front-end with icons.

Differences with the built-in front-end:
- Differents colors for differents backends.
- Icons associated to functions/variables/.. and their backends
- Display candidate's documentation (support quickhelp-string)
- Not limited by the current window size, buffer's text properties

**** Company-Statistics

[[https://github.com/company-mode/company-statistics][Company-statistics]] is a global minor mode
built on top of the in-buffer completion system company-mode. The idea is to keep a log of a
certain number of completions you choose, along with some context information, and use that to
rank candidates the next time you have to choose — hopefully showing you likelier candidates at
the top of the list.

auto completion in html-mode, web-mode, jade-mode, slim-mode and use data of ac-html.
It uses  [[http://company-mode.github.io/][company-mode]].

I do not use this package at the moment. Maybe in the future.

**** Company-try-hard

[[https://github.com/Wilfred/company-try-hard][company-try-hard]] is a package that enhances the [[http://company-mode.github.io/][company-mode]]. It provides a =company-complete= alternative
that tries much harder to find completions. If none of the current completions look good, call
the command again to try the next backend.

| Key binding | Command                | Description                                                                                                                  |

** Project Management

Project management is important in order to be able to  work with projects that consist of many files and that
have special project related rules.

*** Projectile

One of the most important thing to install at first is [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][projectile]],
for manage projects in *Emacs*.

[[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][Projectile]] is a project interaction library for Emacs.
Its goal is to provide a nice set of features operating on a project level without introducing
external dependencies. This library provides easy project management and navigation.

The concept of a project is pretty basic - just a folder containing special file.

See also:
- [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][Projectile]]
- [[https://docs.projectile.mx/projectile][Docs]]

Only the basic commands:
| Key binding | Command                         | Description                                   |

**** projectile-envrc

The package [[https://github.com/hatlafax/projectile-envrc][projectile-envrc]] allows setting, modifying and removing of
process environment variables from simple 'projectile-envrc' description file that resides in the projectile project
root directory.

The file format for '.projectile-envrc' is quite simple:
Only lines that begin with '+', '-', '*:' or ':*' are
considered. Everything else is ignored.

| Specifier | Description |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| =+=       | Add variable/value to the process environent. |
| =-=       | Remove variable from the process environent.  |
| =*:=      | Prepend to the process environment variable.  |
| =:*=      | Append to the process environment variable.   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|

Example:

#+begin_example
    #
    # Hi there this is ignored
    #

    +TIK = Hallo World
    +TAK = "A small test"
    *:PATH = c:/utils/testA

**** Counsel-projectile

Projectile has native support for using ivy as its completion system.
[[https://github.com/ericdanan/counsel-projectile][Counsel-projectile]] provides further ivy integration into projectile by
taking advantage of ivy's support for selecting from a list of actions
and applying an action without leaving the completion session.
Concretely, counsel-projectile defines replacements for existing
projectile commands as well as new commands that have no projectile counterparts.

** Magit

[[https://magit.vc/][Magit]] is an interface to the version control system  [[https://git-scm.com/][Git]] , implemented
as an *Emacs* package.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Magit is a complete text-based user interface to Git. It fills the glaring gap between the Git
command-line interface and various GUIs, letting you perform trivial as well as elaborate version
control tasks with just a couple of mnemonic key presses. Magit looks like a prettified version of
what you get after running a few Git commands but in Magit every bit of visible information is also
actionable to an extent that goes far beyond what any Git GUI provides and it takes care of
automatically refreshing this output when it becomes outdated. In the background Magit just runs
Git commands and if you wish you can see what exactly is being run, making it possible for you to
learn the git command-line by using Magit.

Using Magit for a while will make you a more effective version control user.
Magit supports and streamlines the use of Git features that most users and developers of other
Git clients apparently thought could not be reasonably mapped to a non-command-line interface.
Magit is both faster and more intuitive than either the command line or any GUI and these holds
for both Git beginners and experts alike.

** Else Mode

Peter Milliken has created a minor mode for *Emacs* called the [[https://github.com/peter-milliken/ELSE][Emacs Language Sensitive Editor (ELSE)]].

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[[https://github.com/peter-milliken/ELSE][ELSE]] is a minor mode for *Emacs*, designed to work with any major mode. The aim is to provide a seamless mechanism to
generate language constructs easily and intuitively with a minimum of keystrokes and interference with the user.
It's primary application is a minor mode for any programming language (major mode) but it can be used for any editing
task that involves generation of repetitive text/blocks of text e.g. there is a template file for Texinfo mode.

*** Dap-Mode

The package [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/dap-mode/][dap-mode]] provides an *Emacs* client library that allow the communication to a Debug server that supports
the [[https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/][Debug Adapter Protocol]], which is a wire protocol between the client and the Debug server.  It's similar to the
[[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/][Lsp-mode]] but provides integration with a debug server.

[[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/dap-mode/][Dap-mode]] provides the following commands:

[[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/dap-mode/][Dap-mode]] supports =launch.json= files out of the box, and there is nothing that needs to be enabled. All that
needs to be done is to add a =launch.json= file at the project root and to run =dap-debug=.
All configurations stored in the =launch.json= will automatically show up in the selection.
=launch.json= files in [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/dap-mode/][dap-mode]] are just like in *VSCode* and even support variables.

*** LSP-Mode

[[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/][Lsp-mode]] is a client for [[https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/][Language Server Protocol (v3.14)]]. [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/][Lsp-mode]] aims to provide IDE-like experience by providing
optional integration with the most popular Emacs packages like [[https://company-mode.github.io/][company]], [[https://www.flycheck.org][Flycheck]] and [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][projectile]].

Currently, *Psimacs* uses [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/][lsp-mode]] for the following language modes:
- c-mode
- c++-mode
- cmake-mode

Python-mode is handled by [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy][elpy]] at the moment. That might be changed in the future.

When using [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/][lsp-mode]] most of the features depend on server capabilities.

[[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/][Lsp-mode]] provides default bindings which are dynamically enabled/disabled based on the server functionality.
All the commands are configured =lsp-command-map= which is bound to =lsp-keymap-prefix=.

*Psimacs* bindes [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/][lsp-mode]] commands to key prefix =C-c l=.

Following a survey of the [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/][lsp-mode]] command bindings:

**** lsp-ui

The package [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-ui][lsp-ui]] contains all the higher level UI modules of [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/][lsp-mode]], like [[https://www.flycheck.org][flycheck]] support and code lenses.

Code lenses is a feature originating in the Visual Studio Code galaxy.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
CodeLens is a popular feature in Visual Studio Code. The essence of the feature is
/actionable contextual information interspersed/ in your source code.
That's quite a mouthful. Let me break it down for you.

CodeLens are links in your code:

    - Actionable - You can click on the link and something happens.
    - Contextual - The links are close to the code they are representing.
    - Interspersed - The links located throughout your source code.

*** flycheck-pycheckers

The package [[https://github.com/msherry/flycheck-pycheckers][flycheck-pycheckers]] provides
multiple syntax checker for Python in *Emacs*, using [[http://www.flycheck.org/][Flycheck]].

This package provides a way to run multiple syntax checkers on Python code, in parallel.
The list of supported checkers includes:
- [[https://www.pylint.org/][pylint]]
- [[http://flake8.pycqa.org/][flake8]]
- [[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/][pep8]]
- [[https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes][pyflakes]]
- [[http://mypy-lang.org/][mypy]]
- [[https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit][bandit]]

This is an alternative way of running multiple Python syntax checkers in
[[http://www.flycheck.org/][Flycheck]] that doesn't depend on [[http://www.flycheck.org/][Flycheck's]]
chaining mechanism.

** Org-Mode

Package [[https://orgmode.org][org-mode]] is for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists,
planning projects, and authoring documents with a fast and effective plain-text system.

*** Temporarily workaround Org-Mode problem :noexport:

*Psimacs* relies on features provided by the [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/][Org-mode Contributed Packages]].
At the time of working on this setup, I encountered a problem in the =org-plus-contrib-20200907= package.

The code in this section circumvented the problem by patching one file in this package.
Hopefully, I can get rid of this hack in the near future.

Remove the built-in version of [[https://orgmode.org][org-mode]] from the load-path.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle config/init-major-modes-org-mode.el :var file-description="Major Modes - org-mode setup"
;;
;; Remove the built-in version of org-mode from the load-path.
;;
(require 'cl-seq)
(setq load-path
      (cl-remove-if
       (lambda (x)
         (string-match-p "org$" x))
       load-path))
#+END_SRC

The current =org-plus-contrib-20200907= package does have an error in file =org.el= in line 5320.
We use a loaclly patched version of this package with a fixed =org.el=.
We load this patched package by the following =load-path=  modification.

Check on [[https://orgmode.org/elpa/][OrgElpa]] and on [[https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/org-mode][org-mode]].

Hopefully, this will be fixed upstream in the near future. In that case the following statement is
to be removed and the =:ensure org-plus-contrib= is to be activated.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle config/init-major-modes-org-mode.el
;;
;; Add local path to org-plus-contrib to search path
;;
(add-to-list 'load-path (concat psimacs/config/site-lisp-dir "org-plus-contrib-20200907"))

If the temporary workaround is in use, the =:straight org-plus-contrib= statement needs to be commented!

** CMake

[[https://cmake.org/][CMake]] is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software.

*** CMake-Mode

[[https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/blob/master/Auxiliary/cmake-mode.el][Cmake-mode]] provides syntax
highlighting and indentation for =CMakeLists.txt= and =*.cmake= source files.

*** CMake-IDE :noexport:

[[https://github.com/atilaneves/cmake-ide][cmake-ide]] is a package to enable IDE-like features on Emacs
for CMake projects.

It works by running [[https://cmake.org/][CMake]] in *Emacs* in order to obtain the necessary compiler
flags to pass to the other tools. Since all the dependencies are specified in the CMake scripts, there
is no need to maintain a parallel dependency tracking system for Emacs. Just ask CMake.

See also:
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FQwQ0QWBTU][CppCon 2015 Lightning talk on cmake-ide]]

Remark:
- *Psimacs* currently does not use this package. The package [[https://github.com/hatlafax/projectile-cmake][projectile-cmake]]
  gives fine grained support of [[https://cmake.org/][CMake]] with *Emacs* [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][projectile]].

** Various Shells

The following functions allow you to open various shells inside *Emcas*. Each shell does have its own quirks.
Perfect is none of them. The two commands for starting the [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/][PowerShell]] and the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html][EShell]] are only trivial wrapper
of the simpler commands.
