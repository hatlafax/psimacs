#+HTML:</div>

This is an attempt to create a *Emacs* configuration from the ground up. It has the following objectives:

- Literally programming style. The complete configuration is written in one [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] file.
- Primarily targets the Windows and Linux operating systems. It started on Windows and works very well on that platform.
- Simple to use.
- Provides bootstrapping of used tools.
- [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][Straight]] package manager.
- Support of [[https://www.dropbox.com/][Dropbox]] configuration and file sharing.
- Classic *Emacs* keyboard handling.
- Use of [[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][which-key]]. This is a game changer for me.
- Use of [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][hydra]]. And another beautiful package that I like a lot.
- Use of [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy]]. I started with ivy and I am quite comfortable with it. Likely, [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/ido.html][ido]], [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]] and the more recent incarnations are also worth trying.
- Use of [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][projectile]]. Another great package that I am used to.
- Use of [[http://company-mode.github.io/][company]]. Great text completion framework.
- Use of [[https://github.com/peter-milliken/ELSE][ELSE]] for programming.
- Use of [[https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet][yasnippet]].
- ... and many more packages.
- Focus on ORG, programming and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/][LaTeX]] text writing.

* Motivation

A lot of *Emacs* configurations can be found on the Internet. Many of them are well crafted and could be used out of
the box. Especially, the great *Emacs* distributions like [[https://www.spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs]], [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom-Emacs]] and [[https://github.com/seagle0128/.emacs.d][Centaur-Emacs]] are worth giving it a try.
But I wanted to craft my own configuration that is tailored to my needs and that allows me to learn more about the
vast *Emacs* universe. My configuration it not perfect for everyone, and it will not be able to compete against the big
frameworks that are build by a lot of talented people. So feel free to use it or blame it. I am fine with it.

The name *Psimacs* is arbitrarily. I was in search for a catchy name with just one syllable in front of the *macs*.

* Installation
** Windows
The Powershell script =bootstrap.ps1= is able to bootstrap *Psimacs* and all its dependencies into
the user's =%HOME%\psimacs= directory. No administrator privileges are required for the installation.

Download the raw =booststrap.ps1= file into a temporary directory and run

#+begin_src
.\booststrap.ps1
#+end_src

in a Powershell console.

The *Psimacs* bootstrapping installs the following tools into the =%HOME%\psimacs= directory:

| Tools        | Remarks                                                                                                  |
|--------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [[https://www.msys2.org/][MSYS2]]        | *Psimacs* uses the *Emacs* provided by [[https://www.msys2.org/][MSYS2]]. |
| [[https://conemu.github.io/][ConEmu]]       | Optionally, *Psimacs* can install the [[https://conemu.github.io/][ConEmu]] console emulation. Use option =-conemu= to install the console. |
| [[https://openjdk.org/][Java]]         | *Psimacs* installs the GPL OpenJDK Java distribution provided by Oracle.                                   |
| [[https://languagetool.org][LanguageTool]] | [[https://languagetool.org][LanguageTool]] is a spell and grammar checker supported by *Psimacs*.                                        |
| [[https://pandoc.org/][pandoc]]       | *Psimacs* uses the universal document converter [[https://pandoc.org/][Pandoc]].                                                    |
| [[https://plantuml.com][plantUML]]     | [[https://plantuml.com][PlantUML]] diagram generation is supported by *Psimacs*.                                                     |
| [[https://www.python.org/][python]]       | *Psimacs* installs [[https://www.python.org/][Python]] and uses a virtual environment created from this installation.                   |
| [[https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org][SumatraPDF]]   | *Psimacs* uses the free SumatraPDF viewer.                                                                 |
| [[https://github.com/hatlafax/ELSE-grammar-compiler][ELSE Grammar Compiler]]   | Tool allowing to create ELSE language specification files.                                                                 |
|--------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

To get detail help on the options =bootstrap.ps1= provides run:

#+begin_src
.\booststrap.ps1 --help
#+end_src

On bootstrapping *Psimacs* installs the most recent versions of the tools that are known to work
properly in the context of *Psimacs*. Any other tools used by *Psimacs* are installed within the
[[https://www.msys2.org/][MSYS2]] environment, e.g. [[https://www.doxygen.nl/][doxygen]], [[https://www.graphviz.org/][graphviz]] or [[https://mermaid.js.org/][mermaid]].

The bootstrapping operation tries hard to not modify the target system outside of =%HOME%\psimacs= directory,
but there are some exceptions:

- In case that no =%HOME%= variable is defined inside of the active environment, a variable =%HOME%= is created
  and set to value =c:\home\%UserName%=. After that, the =%HOME%= directory is created, if it does not already exists.
- Bootstrapping installs a number of font files into the user's font directory.
- A raw python installation is performed into the local =%HOME%\psimacs= directory. The official python installer does
  modify the registry, which cannot be avoided easily.
- A number of desktop shortcuts are created.

After bootstrapping, the [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][Straight]] based *Psimacs* configuration is performed on the very first startup
of *Psimacs*. This process takes a couple of minutes and asks two times for confirmation to allow the download of
1. a suitable [[https://github.com/nnicandro/emacs-zmq][emacs-zmq]] binary,
2. for the [[https://github.com/iqbalansari/emacs-emojify][emacs-emojify]] icons.

*Attention:*
- At least 22 GByte of free disk space is used by the default *Psimacs* installation!
- Performing a *Psimacs* bootstrapping operation is at one's own risk!

*Remark:* Windows Powershell typically restricts the execution of scripts. You can
take the following measures in order to get the =bootstrap.ps1= script running:
- Set a proper execution policy for powershell scripts with respect to the user profile:

  #+begin_src powershell
Get-ExecutionPolicy -list
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
  #+end_src

- Downloaded powershell scripts are blocked and not allowed to executed. They need to be unlocked:

  #+begin_src powershell
Unblock-File -Path .\bootstrap.ps1
  #+end_src

Maybe, better ways exists for these problems ;-)

** Linux

*Psimacs* is able to run on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. Currently, no automatic installation method for bootstrapping
*Psimacs* exists on this platform.

Install the following parts:

| Part                  | Source                                                   | Installation                                                                            | Destination / Remark                                                       |

A virtual python environment is used and created by running =python3 -m venv ./python-0/venv/=. This virtual python environment is activated before starting *Psimacs*.
There are better methods, but that worked for me.

** MacOS
Currently, MacOS is also not supported by Psimacs.


* Usage

The full documentation of the configuration can be found in the =init.org= file.
The Org exported html file can be visited [[https://hatlafax.github.io/psimacs][here]].

* Dependencies

*Psimacs* does have a number of dependencies to unfold its full potential. The files =bootstrap.ps1= and
=init.org= details about them.

* Disclaimer

This is an *Emacs* beginners configuration and the usage is at one's own risk. It is not tested thoroughly. Please
bear in mind.

Many of the configuration settings are borrowed from other similar endeavors out there.

This is work in progress. Sometimes this *Readme* is ahead of times or not yet updated.

* Limitations / Known Issues

- Tested on Windows operating system only
- Linux usage on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS is only started recently and does have some rough edges.
